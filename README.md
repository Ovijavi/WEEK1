## Hangout App

### App Description
Everyday we are hanging out with our friends. All the time people have problem to decide where they want to go. This app chooses places where people can meet based on their individual/group location. People can look up for popular or fun location, vote and decide where they will go today.

### App Idea Evaluation

Category: Social, Utility

Market: App benifits people who live in different locations and are indecisive on where to meet or simply want to find somewhere that is available

Habit: Not very habit forming but can be used often when every people go out anytime of the week

Scope: Can be done in a small scope among friends but need to use maps in order to get locations that can be searched
